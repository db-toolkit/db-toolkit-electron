We're thrilled to announce the first beta release of **DB Toolkit** - a modern, cross-platform desktop application designed to simplify database management for developers and database administrators.

## What is DB Toolkit?

DB Toolkit is a powerful database management tool that brings together everything you need to work with databases efficiently. Built with Electron and React, it provides a native desktop experience on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Key Features

### Query Editor with AI Assistant
Write SQL queries with confidence using our Monaco-based editor featuring syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and an AI-powered assistant that helps you write, optimize, and explain queries.

### Data Explorer
Browse and edit table data with inline editing, pagination, and export capabilities. Export your data to CSV or JSON formats with a single click.

### Automated Backups
Never lose your data again. Schedule automated backups with multiple backup types (data-only, schema-only, or full backup), retention policies, and one-click restore.

### Real-time Analytics
Monitor your database performance with live metrics and query execution insights to optimize your database operations.

## Multi-Database Support

DB Toolkit supports the most popular database systems:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
